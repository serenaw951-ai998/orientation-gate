# Use Case: Biological Design & Dual-Use Risk

## Background

Recent advances in AI-driven biological modeling have enabled systems to generate genomic sequences, including bacteriophages and viral structures.

While these capabilities have significant medical potential (e.g., targeting antibiotic-resistant bacteria), they also introduce **dual-use risks** — where the same system can be used for harmful biological design.

The challenge is not whether the AI can generate biological sequences.

The challenge is:

> Should the system be allowed to generate them for a given goal?

## The Core Problem

Standard AI systems optimize for:

- correctness
- usefulness
- task completion

However, in biological design:

> A "correct" output can still be dangerous.

This leads to a critical failure mode:

- The model functions correctly  
- The output is technically valid  
- But the **goal itself is unsafe**

This is not a model failure.

This is an **Orientation failure**.
